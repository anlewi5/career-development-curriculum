## Opening: The Big Picture
### Objectives
* Understand the scope and sequence of Module 4 Professional Development and what support looks like this module
* Identify barriers that may come up for you in the job search
* Identify particular strategies for outreach, networking, branding, and interview prep

### Module 4 Professional Development Scope & Sequence
You're starting your final module at Turing, and we aim to set you up with structured support to help you navigate this successfully. However, you are the driver of your own job search -- take advantage of all of the tools and resources listed here!

### Looking Ahead
In your Module 4, you'll be expected to:

* Complete 1 mock interview and technical challenge
* Submit your [30-day job search action plan](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/post_grad_plan.md) in your portfolio to discuss at the review
* Give your condensed elevator pitch version of your professional story at the portfolio review
* Present your Turing Story, which will be a lightning talk of sorts to describe your Turing journey. Slides are encouraged but optional.

**You Do:** Students skim over the plan and ask any questions that come up (3-5 mins) 

### Professional Development Peer Groups & Coaches

[Reference these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to get your group going on the right track. Students look over the guidelines and ask any questions that come up (3-5 mins)

## (Perceived) Barriers to your Job Search
We can sometimes talk ourselves out of opportunities before we even give them a chance, and we create our own barriers to success.

* Examples of barriers:
	* "I talk myself out of applying to certain jobs because I don’t meet enough of the listed qualifications."
*This is common among women.*
	* "I don’t feel comfortable networking. It feels forced, and I don’t want to do something that doesn’t feel genuine, so I stay home from meet-ups."
	* "Interviews make me really nervous, so I end up performing badly. It’s hard for me to code or communicate on the spot."
	* "I just want a job." When you don't clarify what you want, it can cause your job search to meander, and this could be a barrier for what you really want. 

What are some barriers you might carry with you? Think about these areas:

* Entering the Software Industry
* Outreach
* Networking
* Interviewing (either technical or culture-based questions)
* Personal Branding for yourself
* Other -- what other anxieties do you have that aren't covered in the other categories? 

**You Do:**
Individually, reflect in your journal on barriers that have come up for you in previous job searches and/or that you anticipate could hold you back in your current job search. 
* Why do you think these barriers occur for you? 
* Have you tried to overcome them in the past? If so, what was effective for you? 
* Think about how you answered the "confidence in the job search" question in the survey for PD peer groups. What specific areas bring you confidence? What areas do you feel less confident in?
* What kind of support could you use from your peer group to help you move past these barriers? 
Be prepared to share this information in your group DTR. 

## Strategies & Tools
### Outreach
The number #1 strategy we're going to encourage you to take on in your job search is to pursue relationships over applications. You do this through outreach. Whether it's "warm" outreach in which you utilize your existing network or "cold" outreach in which you initiate contact with someone you haven't met yet, building relationships with others who are already in the technology industry will help you get your foot in the door faster than if you merely submit your resume to online application portals.

To give you a sense of how effective this approach can be, check out [this blog post from 1606-BE alum Jesse Spevack](http://www.jessespevack.com/blog/2017/3/8/get-hired-how-i-went-from-bootcamp-grad-to-engineer) on his job search, specifically on how he utilized outreach in his job search.

**You Do:** Spend 7 minutes reading this blog post (stop at the section that ends immediately before "Technical Challenges") and jot down any points that stick out to you. What parts of Jesse's approach seem doable to you and why? What parts seem daunting to you and why? How can you adapt any of Jesse's advice to your own approach?

**Pair & Share:** Pair up with someone else to share your takeaways from Jesse's blog post.

**Whole Group Discussion:** 
* What value is there in using outreach as a job search strategy?
* What are some ways that you will adapt Jesse's approach in your job search? 2-3 people share out.

Later, you'll use notes that you took here to discuss in your PD peer groups. 

### Networking & Branding
Another way to build relationships is through networking and sharing your story with others. 

**Whole Group:** What's the purpose of going to meetups and other networking events? What are some common barriers that come up that prevent you from going to meetups? How can the benefits outweigh the barriers?

We've discussed the power of storytelling, and this is something you'll continue to practice with your groups. Let's look at what the payoff can be for effective storytelling as describe by two different alumni in their job searches.

**Alumni Connection:** 
Form a group of 3-4 people to listen to these two podcast clips:
* [1606-BE alum Sonia Gupta on the Turing Podcast](http://turingschool.libsyn.com/turing-grads-sonia-gupta-jesse-spevack): Start at 10:10 and listen until 12:20
* [1608-FE alum Matt Kaufman on the Turing Podcast](http://turingschool.libsyn.com/turing-podcast-revival-episode-5-turing-grads-the-real-world): Start at 6:50 and listen until until 9:12

Discuss with your group:
* What does it mean to show off your "authentic self"? How does this relate to your job search?  
* What do you think impresses employers in a first look at a Turing portfolio?
* How could you impress companies right now with your capstone projects and/or adding to your existing projects? Outline 1-2 strategies to use to make your portfolios impressive

**Whole Group:** Share out some takeaways to the whole group

### Technical Interview Prep
Overview of what technical interview prep will look like this module:
* Back End: Mock interviews with Ian Douglas
* Front End: Mock interviews with Brittany Storoz
* Several opportunities to practice challenges in class
* Check out [these resources](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/technical_interview_prep_resources.md)

**You Do:** List out what you feel are your current strengths and weaknesses when it comes to technical interviews. How can you focus your time during technical interview prep sessions and mock interviews to help you capitalize on your strengths and improve your weaknesses?

### Closing: Break into Groups
You'll meet with your peer groups to get started strategizing on your job search. **You've been grouped according to the timeline that you said you'd need a job by.** Keep this in mind as you plan together. You'll see who your coach is but won't meet with them until Week 2. 

Start with a DTR to get on the same page about your job search goals, barriers you might place on yourself in this job search, how you want to communicate with each other, and ideas for how you can motivate and hold each other accountable. [Use these guidelines](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/guidelines_for_peer_groups.md) to help structure your time.
