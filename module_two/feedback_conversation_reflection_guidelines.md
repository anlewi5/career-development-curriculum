# Feedback II Reflection

* Date of feedback conversation: 10/12/2017


* How did you prepare for the conversation?
<br>
I prepared for the conversation by reflecting on our work as a group and coming up with a list of "goods" and "work more on" topics to discuss.


* How did the conversation go for you? What was easy about the conversation? What was more difficult? 
<br>
The conversation went well because our group worked well for the most part and I didn't have many concerns to address. I think it would be a lot more difficult if I had a lot of controversial issues to bring to the foreground.


* What principles of feedback did you use in the conversation?
<br>
This feedback was coaching and appreciation. I had not worked with any members in my group before and so I was unable to provide the timeline needed for evaluative feedback.


* Any other comments:
